## The Magic: DocTypes

The heart of Frappe is the **DocType**.

A **DocType** is a blueprint for data. For example:
- `Customer` (a type of document)
- `Sales Order` (another document type)

Each DocType automatically gives you:
- A **database table**
- A **form to fill out**
- A **list view**
- **Permissions, workflows, and APIs**

You define the structure (e.g., fields like name, email), and Frappe builds everything else.

## Real-World Example: ERPNext

It’s a full business management system used by thousands of companies worldwide.

And the best part?  
It’s **100% free and open source** — built entirely on the Frappe framework.
